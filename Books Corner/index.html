        <p class="p1">An Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago dreams of a treasure while in a ruined church. He
            consults a Gypsy
            fortune-teller about the meaning of the recurring dream. The woman interprets it as a prophecy, telling the
            boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids.

            After Santiago sets out, he meets an old king Melchizedek, or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his
            sheep so as to travel to Egypt and accomplish his 'Personal Legend'. Early on his arrival in Africa, a man
            who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead robs him of the money he had made from his
            flock. Santiago then has to work for a crystal merchant so to earn enough to get to the pyramids.</p>

                Wikipedia</a></h5>
        <p class="p2">The narrator describes his experience walking in the streets of St. Petersburg. He loves the city
            at night,
            and feels comfortable in it. Because all the people he is used to seeing are not there, he no longer feels
            comfortable during the day. He drew his emotions from them: if they were happy, he was happy; if they were
            despondent, he was despondent. New faces made him feel alone. As he walked, the houses would talk to him and
            tell him how they were being renovated or painted a new color or torn down.

            He lives alone in a small apartment in Saint Petersburg with only his old and unsociable maid Matryona to
            keep him company. He tells the story of his relationship with a young woman, Nastenka (a diminutive of the
            name Anastasia). He becomes concerned and considers
            asking her what is wrong, but eventually, he continues walking. There is something special about her, and he
            is very curious. When he hears her scream, he intervenes and saves her from a man who is harassing her.</p>
