        <h2>Paulo Coelho</h2>
        <h3>Born: 24 August 1947</h3>
        <h3>Nationality: Brazilian</h3>

        <p class="p1">Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and attended a Jesuit school. At 17, Coelho's
            parents committed him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the
            age of 20. Coelho later remarked that "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know
            what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me."At his parents' wishes,
            Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out
            and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started
            using drugs in the 1960s.</p>

        <h2>Fyodor Dostoevsky</h2>
        <h3>Born: 11 November 1821</h3>
        <h3>Nationality: Russian</h3>
        <h5 class="navh5" style="margin-left: 45px; font-size: 15px;"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky - Wikipedia</a></h5>
        <p class="p1">Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy
            tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15,
            and around the same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After
            graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra
            money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry into Saint Petersburg's
            literary circles. However, he was arrested in 1849 for belonging to a literary group, the Petrashevsky
            Circle, that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia. Dostoevsky was sentenced to death but the
            sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six
            years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist,
            publishing and editing several magazines of his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his
            writings. He began to travel around western Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to
            financial hardship. For a time, he had to beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely
            read and highly regarded Russian writers.</p>
